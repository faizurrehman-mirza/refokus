Welcome to your Refokus clone — great job! This README keeps things short, friendly and practical.

## Quick start

- Install:

```bash
npm install
```

- Start dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Build (optional):

```bash
npm run build
```


## 🚀 Show it to the world (push)

Made some tweaks? Commit locally, then share your changes to GitHub using your preferred tool (GitHub Desktop, VS Code, or the GitHub website). No command needed here — just push when you're ready.

Psst — want me to prepare a tiny demo video or add `public/videos/` for you? I can do that next.
